- Home page should display the main counters of devices in-work and a map with them.
- Ability to create types of devices (for example "Generators", "Drives"...) with their own custom properties (and property options).
- After creating each device, a unique license-key should be generated for it and sent to corresponding manager. (This procedure is also optional for device type).
- There are different types users with different privileges: Manager, Head-Manager and Administrator.
- Ability to download the whole DB, for backup purposes.
- Sort, filter table of devices, search in a various fields with smart autocompletion. Also filter them on map.
- On-the-fly validation during submitting device-adding form (for example, if device with this serial â„– already exists).
- Doployment on Beget.
